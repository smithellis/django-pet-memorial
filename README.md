# CVM Pet Memorial

A tool that allows veterinary hospitals to record information about deceased pets and send donations to the College of Veterinary Medicine. In turn, we notify the client that their pet has been honored and a contribution made on their behalf.

This is a new, in progress version. Originally developed in Flask, this is an improved Django version. Flask is awesome, but Django should allow a bit more robust admin, more mature security and a bit more opportunity for me to write code.

Go team!
